# Development Process

## Sprint Start (Wednesday)

- get ticket assigned

## Before Beginning to Write Code

- select Reviewer
- talk to Reviewer until when he needs the finished issue so they can review before end of sprint, e.g. Reviewer says if you finish it till Monday midday, I can review it until Tuesday morning

## After Fulfilling Issue

### Check in clean project (no local changes or new clone):
- useful comments are written?
- is everything building from scratch?
- is it documented how to run exactly?
- are all tests running?

### Review:
- tell Reviewer to Review
- after Review and fixing comments and Reviewer says its okay: Assigne can merge
- put issue in `awaiting review` on project board

## Merge Stop: Tuesday 18:00!
